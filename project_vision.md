The details of how the Library Management fulfills these needs are detailed in the use-case and supplementary specifications.

The introduction of the Vision document provides an overview of the entire document. It includes the purpose, scope, definitions, acronyms, abbreviations, references, and overview of this Vision document.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to implement a useful way to borrow a book. Readers usually tend to forget the date to resubmit their library books so these books that have been issued to the reader and have reached their expiry date, an e-mail notification is sent to the reader automatically by the system to remind him about the book return date.

## Scope
The system would make the book borrowing more convenient. The readers will know exactly if a book is available and otherwise since when is it available. The main scope is to make the system applicable in any library.
