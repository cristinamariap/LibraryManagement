# Library Supplementary Specification

# Introduction
[The introduction of the Supplementary Specification provides an overview of the entire document.
The Supplementary Specification captures the system requirements that are not readily captured in the use cases of the use-case model. Such requirements include:
Legal and regulatory requirements, including application standards.
Quality attributes of the system to be built, including usability, reliability, performance, and supportability requirements.
Other requirements such as operating systems and environments, compatibility requirements, and design constraints.]

# Non-functional Requirements

[Define system quality attributes in terms of scenarios according to the following template:
-	Quality attribute definition
-	Source of stimulus: the entity (human or another system) that generated the stimulus or event
-	Stimulus: a condition that determines a reaction of the system
-	Environment: the current condition of the system when the stimulus arrives
-	Artifact: is a component that reacts to the stimulus. It may be the whole system or some pieces of it
-	Response: the activity determined by the arrival of the stimulus
-	Response measure: the quantifiable indication of the response
-	Tactics

## Availability
[Availability means the probability that a system is operational at a given time. Availability is typically given as a percentage of the time a system is expected to be available. ]
## Performance
[Short response time for a given piece of work. So the time is an important factor that has to be taken into account when speaking about performance.]
## Security
[Control of access to a computer system's resources, specially its data and operating system files. So it is the ability of the system to prevent undesired persons to use it.]
## Testability
[Software testability is the degree to which a software artifact(i.e. a software system, software module, requirements- or design document) supports testing in a given test context. If the testability of the software artifact is high, then finding faults in the system(if it has any) by means of testing is easier.]
## Usability
[Usability is the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object such as a tool or device. In software engineering, usability is the degree to which a software can be used by specified consumers to achieve quantified objectives whith effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use.]
# Design Constraints
There are some design constraints which must appear:
	- Programming languages: Java
	- Technologies: Hibernate, Spring MVC
	- Architectural constraints: layered
